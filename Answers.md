1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?  

React is a JavaScript component library that focuses on rendering UI or "view." It is efficient because it renders and updates components without the need for a full refresh. React components are also highly reusable.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?  

Thinking in React means applying a workflow methodology that takes advantage of the benefits of React by design and developing in a compartmentalized, component based hierarchical structure that can handle state and pass data efficiently.  

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.  

Functional components are more basic components that focus on rendering and returning UI/presentational elements without handling state. Class components are considered stateful because they have access to state and life cycle methods.  

1.  Describe state.  

State is essentially an object that is comprised of that components data which can be passed down to other components as props.  

1.  Describe props.  

Props are essentially read-only data in the form of custom attributes that allows us to pass data to and from different components within the application.
